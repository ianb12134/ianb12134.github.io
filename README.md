## Professional Self-Assessment

Hi, my name is Ian Benoit and welcome to my ePortfolio for CS-499 Capstone. Throughout my time at SNHU I have learned many useful concepts and tools that will help me in my career. I began in the Computer Science Program in August of 2021. When I first started with this I was unsure if I was going to be able to complete it as it seemed as an insurmountable. Though, through my journey I have had the pleasure of being taught by amazing professors and an advisor that has been with me every step of the way. In completing this journey I plan to explore certification oppourtunities with the given skill set I have gained. 

Throughout the computer science bachelor degree program I have seen reoccuring themes. These themes are security, software engineering, databases, data structures, algorithms, communicating with stakeholders or other people with less technical knowledge, and collaboration within a team environment. These are all concepts that are important when looking to gain employment in the computer science field. Some of these concepts go together such as data structures and algorithms. These are a staple of the software development space. Almost all programs that are used to run the world rely on data structures and algorithms. This was one of the first concepts I learned and it set a solid foundation for me as I made it through this program. Software engineering and database configuration and managment were large portions of this degree as well. Taking an idea from a stake holder and turning it into a tangeable asset that they are able to utilize to better function within thier given space is a great feeling. Designing solutions for people is one of the reasons I got into the computer science. Databases have been an intersting part of my time at SNHU. I honestly did not think that I was going to like databases as I thought they would be too complex but I was able to be successful due to having guidence from professors. Collaboration with teams is something that I had explored in a few classes and something that build off of my previous experinces. Explaining or communicating with stake holders was something I found intersting. I enjoyed explaining a complex concept in a way that was digestable for someone from outside of the field.

The artifacts that are included in this portfolio demonstrate the proficiency I was able to achieve with SNHU. The artifacts that i have included will show growth and understanding of the basics of computer science and the ability to understand the newest parts of the field. My first artifact is one of the first programs I have coded from IT-140. The artifact is a game that I wrote that is text-based and the user/player had to navigate a house, collect evidence, and confront a murder suspect to make the arrest and win the game. I included this as it is what set a base for me in this degree program. My next artifact is from CS-370 and the artifact is the final. This class centered on AI and I had to complete and AI program for a pirate to find treasure on a map that changed every itteration. I included this to show that I am able to conquer new and complex topics. My last artifact is from DAD-220 and it is the course work for the database that I had created throughout the term. It shows my ability and growth in creating a SQL database and create tools to make the database more useful. 

## Code Review

The informal code review shows an indepth disection of my first artifact. I went through each and every line and many different factors within the code. This was to make sure that the program was up to industry best standards and performed within parameters set forth for the assignment. Below is a link to the two videos that contain the code review. https://youtu.be/K6I-RgsEC3E and https://youtu.be/9MH46gjimL8
