## Professional Self-Assessment

Hi, my name is Ian Benoit and welcome to my ePortfolio for CS-499 Capstone. Throughout my time at SNHU I have learned many useful concepts and tools that will help me in my career. I began in the Computer Science Program in August of 2021. When I first started with this I was unsure if I was going to be able to complete it as it seemed as an insurmountable. Though, through my journey I have had the pleasure of being taught by amazing professors and an advisor that has been with me every step of the way. In completing this journey I plan to explore certification oppourtunities with the given skill set I have gained. 

Throughout the computer science bachelor degree program I have seen reoccuring themes. These themes are security, software engineering, databases, data structures, algorithms, communicating with stakeholders or other people with less technical knowledge, and collaboration within a team environment. These are all concepts that are important when looking to gain employment in the computer science field. Some of these concepts go together such as data structures and algorithms. These are a staple of the software development space. Almost all programs that are used to run the world rely on data structures and algorithms. This was one of the first concepts I learned and it set a solid foundation for me as I made it through this program. Software engineering and database configuration and managment were large portions of this degree as well. Taking an idea from a stake holder and turning it into a tangeable asset that they are able to utilize to better function within thier given space is a great feeling. Designing solutions for people is one of the reasons I got into the computer science. Databases have been an intersting part of my time at SNHU. I honestly did not think that I was going to like databases as I thought they would be too complex but I was able to be successful due to having guidence from professors. Collaboration with teams is something that I had explored in a few classes and something that build off of my previous experinces. Explaining or communicating with stake holders was something I found interesting. I enjoyed explaining a complex concept in a way that was digestable for someone from outside of the field.

The artifacts that are included in this portfolio demonstrate the proficiency I was able to achieve with SNHU. The artifacts that i have included will show growth and understanding of the basics of computer science and the ability to understand the newest parts of the field. My first artifact is one of the first programs I have coded from IT-140. The artifact is a game that I wrote that is text-based and the user/player had to navigate a house, collect evidence, and confront a murder suspect to make the arrest and win the game. I included this as it is what set a base for me in this degree program. My next artifact is from CS-370 and the artifact is the final. This class centered on AI and I had to complete and AI program for a pirate to find treasure on a map that changed every itteration. I included this to show that I am able to conquer new and complex topics. My last artifact is from DAD-220 and it is the course work for the database that I had created throughout the term. It shows my ability and growth in creating a SQL database and create tools to make the database more useful. 

## Code Review

The informal code review shows an indepth disection of my first artifact. I went through each and every line and many different factors within the code. This was to make sure that the program was up to industry best standards and performed within parameters set forth for the assignment. Below is a link to the two videos that contain the code review.

## Artifact 1: Software Design and Engineering

My first artifact to show my understanding of software design and engineering is from one of my first classes along my journey. I used Python in this assingment to create a game where the user is a dectective and needs to navigate a mansion and collect evidence before confronting the prime suspect. If the user is able to collect all of the evidence the suspect is arrested and the player wins. If the player confronts the suspect before collecting all of the evidence the suspect goes free. For this to be successful I had to create the map and allowable directions given the players current position. I also had to create and inventory and a system for removing evidence from a room once it was picked up by the user. The enhancement that I have done for this artifact is that I added a map funciton. This allows a user to see a map of the mansion. The map does not show the user which room they are in due to the game telling them once the enter a room what room they are in. I felt it was redundant and it adds a difficulty to the game as the user needs to pay attention.

## Artifact 2: Algorithms and Data Structures

My second artifact to show my understanding of algorithms and data structures is one of the projects I am most proud of. In this artifact I used a basic AI algorithm to create a program that allowed machine learning. The program that I had to complete was a 'game' if you will for the AI. The AI was a pirate that was looking for a treasure chest. The goal of the AI algorithm is to take past attempts to find the chest and find a more efficient way to find it. The chest was randomized and the pirate was also randomized. The enhancement is that the pirate location is randomized. When I first cubmitted this project I was unable to get it to work properly so, for the enhancement I found a way to fix my error. Now the pirate and the treasure both have a random starting position and the AI still is able to learn from past attempts to get better at finding the chest. This machine learning is the basis for AI.

## Artifact 3: Databases

My third and final artifact to show  my understanding of databses comes from DAD-220. This course was set up as a client had reached out to you and requested a SQL database be written for them. I then took all of the assingments and put them together to show how it grew into the final project for the course. The enhancement that was planned for this was to speak with the client about security issues and possibly moving the database to non-SQL. Ultimately the security that a physical SQL database won out based on the client's needs. I also tried to identify trends that the client was doing to attempt to make more specialized tools and tables for the client to use. This artifact shows my understanding of databases and balancing features and security.
